This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent key prop to the items being rendered.  The key prop must be unique and immutable for each item in your data array. If keys are not unique or are changed, FlatList can lead to unexpected behavior like incorrect rendering, crashes, or performance issues.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage:
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 3' }]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

In this example, the `id` 1 is duplicated, violating the uniqueness requirement. This often leads to the `index` being used incorrectly during updates, causing the FlatList to render unexpectedly.
